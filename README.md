PUZKA is a personal assistant Android app developed to help users manage their daily tasks efficiently. The app integrates multiple features, including a notepad for quick text entry, a transaction manager for tracking expenses, and a routine manager to organize daily schedules. A drawing tool allows users to create sketches, while the image-to-text recognizer, powered by Firebase ML Kit, converts images into editable text.
